barcelona held, as it did last year, the [radare](https://rada.re/) conference [r2con2017](https://rada.re/con/2017/) with its focus on manual and automated reverse engineering, static and dynamic analysis, fuzzing, forensics, exploiting, unpacking, malware, and many more. it also allowed attendees and developers to meet and discuss design and implementation tips for the future of the project.

the event started the 7th at ![Universitat de Barcelona, historical building](http://www.ub.edu/web/ub/galeries/imatges/sala_premsa/grans/CENTRAL/8.jpg "UB historical building"), amazing venue, the place was in the middle of the city, made you feel like in Harry Potter's Hogwarts school. the first day had 2 trainings scheduled:

-Beginners training by pancake and alvaro_fe: starting almost from 0, they explained how to download, install, set up and run our first analysis with r2, showing how to modify configuration variables and solving doubts. it's good for people new at r2, but also for experienced users, there are always things to learn when it comes to r2.


-Intro to Unpacking on Windows by newlog, Giomismo and zlowram: they covered the basics of packers in a initial theoretical part of the training. have to admit that it was extremely well explained by newlog, in a way even newbies wouldn't miss the track of the session. also useful r2 commands for unpacking, debugging, memory dumping and parsing. afterwards they distributed some windows images to start the training unpacking Locky malware. they did it in a really educational way, allowing attendees to try and from time to time revealing some hints in order to help and speed up.


there was also a hackathon to learn, ask, experiment, play but I did not attend (unpacking training sounded too good to miss it).
